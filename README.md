# BackupSchool
A horrid mess of C++ that copies modified files to a backup location. I like the UI though.

This thingy searches the specified directory in the config file for files that have been changed.
It then checks if those files have already been backed up today. If they haven't, it presents a
list of files that can be backed up.

To build, try using the makefile. It might work, but it probably won't.
